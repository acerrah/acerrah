Iâ€™m a DevOps & Platform Engineer who likes to keep things simple, efficient, and automated. No unnecessary complexityâ€”just clean, scalable, and production-ready solutions. I work with CI/CD, containers, cloud, monitoring, and infrastructure as code, always aiming for reliability and speed.

Take a look around, fork what you like, and letâ€™s build something cool. ðŸš€
